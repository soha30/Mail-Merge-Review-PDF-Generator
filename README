# Mail Merge Document Generator

## Overview
This project is an ASP.NET Web Forms application that demonstrates how to generate customized documents from Word templates using a reusable mail-merge helper class.  
The application loads a `.dotx` template, injects dynamic values into placeholders, and saves the output as Word or PDF files on the server.

## Main Features
- Use a Word template (`.dotx`) with predefined placeholders.
- Replace placeholders with dynamic values (such as names, dates, and custom text).
- Generate new documents based on the template.
- Export and save generated files (Word/PDF) into result folders.
- Simple web pages to trigger the document generation process.

## Technology Stack
- **Framework:** ASP.NET Web Forms (C#)
- **Language:** C#
- **Front-end:** ASP.NET WebForms + JavaScript
- **Templates:** Microsoft Word `.dotx` files
- **Output:** Word / PDF files stored on the server

## Project Structure (High Level)
- `App_Code/`  
  Contains shared helper classes, including the mail-merge class used to manipulate the Word template and generate documents.

- `Template/`  
  Contains the main Word templates used as the base for the mail-merge process (for example, templates with watermark and placeholders).

- `myTemplate/`  
  Contains updated or customized versions of the Word templates used in the demo.

- `Result/` and `myPdf/`  
  Folders for storing generated output files (such as merged Word documents or exported PDFs).

- `Default.aspx` and other pages  
  Web pages that allow the user to trigger mail-merge operations and interact with the document generation demo.

## How It Works (Conceptual Flow)
1. The user (or the code) selects a Word template from the template folders.
2. A mail-merge helper class (in `App_Code`) opens the template and finds predefined placeholders.
3. The application passes dynamic values (for example: name, address, message text) to the helper class.
4. The helper class replaces placeholders with real data and creates a new document instance.
5. The new document is saved on the server in the result folders (Word or PDF).
6. The user can open or download the generated document.

## Internal API (Mail-Merge Helper Class)
Instead of exposing a public Web API, the project uses an internal C# "API" (helper class) in `App_Code` that:
- Loads the Word template.
- Accepts input values as parameters.
- Applies mail-merge logic to the template.
- Saves the generated file to the appropriate folder.

This internal API can be reused in other pages or projects that need the same document-generation behavior.

## Use Cases
- Generating personalized invitation letters.
- Creating certificates or reports based on a standard template.
- Automating document creation for students, clients, or internal reviews.

## How to Run the Project
1. Open the solution file `ali1982ReviewMailmerge.sln` in Visual Studio.
2. Restore NuGet packages if needed.
3. Run the project using IIS Express.
4. Navigate to the main demo page (such as `Default.aspx` or the custom demo page) and execute the mail-merge actions.
